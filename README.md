# Arduino-Projects
I began learning electronics for fun. After a short time, I went back to school to study electrical engineering.
I found it uniquely interesting, and I wanted to learn the theory.

I've created this repository to house my arduino code for projects I'm listing on my website for learners to use!

Enjoy!
